# Kafka Multi-Terminal Lab: Full System Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Kafka environment configured across six terminals, demonstrating both **Load Balancing** (Queueing) and **Fan-out** (Publish/Subscribe) architectures.

## 🏗️ System Architecture



| Terminal | Process Role | Topic | Group Name | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Terminal 1** | Infrastructure | N/A | N/A | **Broker/Coordinator** |
| **Terminal 2** | Consumer Instance 1 | `queue-test` | `app1` | **Load Balancing** |
| **Terminal 3** | Consumer Instance 2 | `queue-test` | `app1` | **Load Balancing** |
| **Terminal 4** | Consumer Instance 3 | `topic-test` | `app2` | **Fan-out (Sub A)** |
| **Terminal 5** | Consumer Instance 4 | `topic-test` | `app3` | **Fan-out (Sub B)** |
| **Terminal 6** | Producer | `topic-test` | N/A | **Data Entry** |

## 💻 Terminal-by-Terminal Commands

### Terminal 1: Infrastructure & Topics
This terminal hosts the server processes and the initial topic definitions.
```bash
# 1. Start Zookeeper (The Manager)
/app/confluent-7.9.1/bin/zookeeper-server-start /app/confluent-7.9.1/etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties >/dev/null&

# 2. Start Kafka Broker (The Storage Engine)
/app/confluent-7.9.1/bin/kafka-server-start /app/confluent-7.9.1/etc/kafka/server.properties >/dev/null&

# 3. Create Topics (2 Partitions each)
/app/confluent-7.9.1/bin/kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic queue-test --partitions 2 --replication-factor 1
/app/confluent-7.9.1/bin/kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic topic-test --partitions 2 --replication-factor 1
```

### Terminal 2: Consumer Group app1 (Instance 1)
Designed to handle half the load of the `queue-test` topic.

```bash
export TOPIC_NAME=queue-test
export CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME=app1
java -cp ".:/opt/kafka/libs/*" com.example.KafkaConsumerExample
```
### Terminal 3: Consumer Group app1 (Instance 2)
Designed to handle the other half of the load of the queue-test topic.
```bash
export TOPIC_NAME=queue-test
export CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME=app1
java -cp ".:/opt/kafka/libs/*" com.example.KafkaConsumerExample
```

### Terminal 4: Consumer Group app2
An independent subscriber listening to topic-test. It receives every message sent to this topic.

```
export TOPIC_NAME=topic-test
export CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME=app2
java -cp ".:/opt/kafka/libs/*" com.example.KafkaConsumerExample
```
### Terminal 5: Consumer Group app3
A second independent subscriber listening to topic-test. It also receives every message sent to this topic.

```
export TOPIC_NAME=topic-test
export CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME=app3
java -cp ".:/opt/kafka/libs/*" com.example.KafkaConsumerExample
```

### Terminal 6: Keyed Producer
This terminal is used to manually send messages into the system.

```
./kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic topic-test --property "parse.key=true" --property "key.separator=:"
# Input format: KEY:VALUE (e.g., user1:login_event)
```
### 🎓 Key Concepts Demonstrated
1. Load Balancing (T2 & T3)
When multiple consumers share the same CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME, Kafka treats them as a team. Since queue-test has 2 partitions, Kafka assigns Partition 0 to Terminal 2 and Partition 1 to Terminal 3.

2. Fan-out / Pub-Sub (T4 & T5)
Because Terminal 4 and Terminal 5 have different group names (app2 vs app3), they do not share the load. Instead, they each get a private copy of the data stream. This is ideal for microservices where multiple apps need the same data (e.g., an Analytics service and an Email service).

3. Keyed Message Routing
By using key:value in Terminal 6, Kafka hashes the key to decide which partition the message goes to. This ensures that all messages for the same key (like the same User ID) are processed in order by the same consumer.

### kafka-consumer-groups tool.
- To see exactly how Kafka has distributed the partitions among your active terminals, you use the kafka-consumer-groups tool. This is the best way to verify that your `Load Balancing` (Terminal 2 & 3) and `Fan-out` (Terminal 4 & 5) setups are working as intended

Open a 7th Terminal (or use Terminal 1) and run these commands:
1. __Check the Load Balanced Group (app1):__
This will show you how Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 have split the work for queue-test.

```
app/confluent-7.9.1/bin/kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group app1
```

__What to look for in the output:__
- You should see two rows (one for Partition 0 and one for Partition 1)
- Look at the CONSUMER-ID and HOST columns. You will see two different IDs, confirming that Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 are each handling one specific partition.
2. __Check the Fan-out Groups (app2 or app3):__ 
Run this to see how a single consumer handles an entire topic.
```
/app/confluent-7.9.1/bin/kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group app2
```
__What to look for in the output:__
- You will still see two rows (Partition 0 and 1).
- However, both rows will have the same CONSUMER-ID. This confirms that Terminal 4 is solely responsible for the entire topic because it is the only member of that group.

__Understanding the Output Columns__

When you run the commands above, you will see a table. Here is what the columns mean:
|Column|Meaning|
|------|:-------|
|PARTITION | The specific "lane" of the topic being read.|
|CURRENT-OFFSET|The last message number the consumer successfully read.|
|LOG-END-OFFSET|The last message number that exists in the Kafka broker.|
|LAG|The number of messages waiting to be processed (LOG-END-OFFSET minus CURRENT-OFFSET).|
|CONSUMER-ID|The unique name Kafka gave to your specific Terminal window.|

#### The "Rebalance" Test
-If you want to see Kafka's intelligence in action:
- Keep the describe command ready in your 7th terminal.
- Kill Terminal 2 (Ctrl+C).
- Run the describe command for app1 again immediately.
- You will see that Terminal 3 has automatically taken over both Partition 0 and Partition 1. This is "Rebalancing".
